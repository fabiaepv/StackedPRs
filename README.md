# Stacked PR's

### What are stacked pull requests?

Stacked PRs, also know as dependent, incremental, or chained PRs, are pull requests that branch off from other pull requests. In git terms, they are feature branches that are checked out from other feature branches to build small and coherent units to represent changes.

## When and why should you use stacked PRs?

- To split large PRs
- To share a piece of code between multiple feature branches
- To make it easy for two people to work on the same feature



> Note: Stacked PRs are useful when wanting to split large pull requests. The other situation where stacked PRs really shine is when you want to use a particular change. in two or more branches.
